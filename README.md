Here are all the files I either created from scratch and modified for my Ender 3 V2 conversion.

Below is the screen mount I designed from scratch which is for the BTT Pi TFT50 screen (in my oppinion its the best screen you can get for a printer). This fits directly into the standard middle grill so that no further modificationes need to be made.

For those with the BTT Pi TFT43 screen, I have created a 2 piece screen mount (was my initial design) that also fits onto the standard middle grill.

The Raspberry Pi mount was modified to be placed on the opposite side of the printer as the USB cable between the mainboard and Raspberry Pi would not fit due to clearance issues.

For my Ender 3 V2 the rear skirt for the power supply needed to be modified to use back the original plug and switch.

For my Ender 3 V2 the extrusion cutout guard did not fit as its 40mm wide so I have created one that fits.

Last but not least is the Wago mount that I used to manage the main power wires to the 24V PSU.<br>
