Below is the screen mount I designed from scratch which is for the BTT Pi TFT50 screen (in my oppinion its the best screen you can get for a printer). This fits directly into the standard middle grill so that no further modificationes need to be made.

For those with the BTT Pi TFT43 screen, I have created a 2 piece screen mount (was my initial design) that also fits onto the standard middle grill.
